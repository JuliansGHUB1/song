# song
## This project is basically me making a program that plays a list of songs, with the ability to pause play and fast forward.
## I started this project about maybe 3 weeks ago and have worked on it for about 10 hours maybe? It's been fun and I've learned a lot
## about pygame, double buffering(for the surfaces and stuff) and just applying a lot of the stuff I've learned just messing around on edabit and leetcode
## i doubt anyone on this site would care but if u need any help understanding my very poorly written code, let me know
